# Deforestation-Case study

## Introduction:
ForestQuery is a non-profit organization focused on reducing global deforestation. The leadership team seeks insights into global forestation trends from 1990 to 2016. Their goal is to identify regions and countries where forests are diminishing and those with significant forest areas. This information will guide resource allocation to maximize impact.

## Methodology:
Data was sourced from three tables: `forest_area`, `land_area`, and `regions`. These tables were merged to form a "forestation" view. This view includes forest areas, land areas, regions, and a calculated percentage of land designated as forest. Given that forest and land areas were in different units (sq km and sq mi), a unit conversion was necessary.

## Key Findings:

### 1. Global Situation:
- **1990**: Global forest area was approximately 41,282,694.9 sq km.
- **2016**: This reduced to about 39,958,245.9 sq km.
- **Net Reduction**: 1,324,449 sq km from 1990 to 2016, translating to a percentage decrease of 3.21%. This lost forest area is almost equivalent to Peru's total area in 2016.

### 2. Regional Outlook:
- **2016**: The global forestation percentage was 31.38%. The Latin America & Caribbean region led with 46.16% forestation, while the Middle East & North Africa lagged at 2.07%.
- **1990**: Global forestation was slightly higher at 32.42%. The Latin America & Caribbean region had 51.03% forestation, and the Middle East & North Africa had 1.78%.
- **Decreased Forestation (1990-2016)**: Latin America & Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa regions experienced significant forestation decline.

### 3. Country-Level Detail:
- **Largest Forest Reduction (1990-2016)**: Brazil, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria, and Tanzania faced the most significant forest area decreases.
- **Percentage Decline Leaders**: Togo, Nigeria, Uganda, Mauritania, and Honduras.
- **Comparison with the US (2016)**: 94 countries had a forestation percentage surpassing the United States.

## Recommendations:
  **Highlights -**
1. **Prioritize Latin America & Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa**: These regions have seen substantial forestation declines.
2. **Focus on Brazil, Indonesia, and Nigeria**: These countries have witnessed significant forest area reductions and may benefit from targeted interventions.
3. **Learn from Success Stories**: Recognize countries that have maintained or increased their forestation levels to derive best practices.

- After carefully examining the available data, it is clear that about 3% of the forest area has been destroyed. However, it is essential to pinpoint the precise regions in extreme need if you want to make a significant impact. A thorough examination of the growth outcomes attained in China leads to the conclusion that further research and study of the methods used there could significantly advance our knowledge of effective methods for the development of forests. Given China's vast land area, there are many lessons to be learned from their experiences, but we need also consider the insightful study data obtained from smaller nations where growth can be simpler to attain.

- While acknowledging Iceland's amazing growth rate of over 200% is significant, it's crucial to keep the main goal of this plan in mind. The location that requires priority attention is thus shown by the results below: Africa sub-Saharan. Sub-Saharan Africa is among the top 5 regions in terms of both square kilometers lost and percentage loss, but many other regions of the world demand attention. The greatest benefit to the world's forests would come from reforestation in this area.

- It is crucial to concentrate on the four key regions of Sub-Saharan Africa that have significant forest loss: Togo, Nigeria, Uganda, and Mauritania, in order to further focus our attention there. We can significantly aid in the restoration and preservation of forest areas by tackling the problems present in these locations.

- The proposal offers a clearer and more structured framework for tackling the issue at hand by combining these enhancements. It emphasizes the significance of studying effective approaches from nations like China while highlighting the necessity of giving Sub-Saharan Africa first priority because of its significant loss of forests. Additionally, it identifies particular Sub-Saharan African regions that demand rapid attention.

## Conclusion:
The data provides a roadmap for ForestQuery's leadership. With a clear understanding of global and regional trends, the team can allocate resources efficiently and design impactful interventions. The findings underscore the urgency required in specific regions while also highlighting potential success stories.

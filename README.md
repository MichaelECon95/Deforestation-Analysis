# Deforestation-Case study

## Introduction:
ForestQuery is a non-profit organization focused on reducing global deforestation. The leadership team seeks insights into global forestation trends from 1990 to 2016. Their goal is to identify regions and countries where forests are diminishing and those with significant forest areas. This information will guide resource allocation to maximize impact.

## Methodology:
Data was sourced from three tables: `forest_area`, `land_area`, and `regions`. These tables were merged to form a "forestation" view. This view includes forest areas, land areas, regions, and a calculated percentage of land designated as forest. Given that forest and land areas were in different units (sq km and sq mi), a unit conversion was necessary.

## Key Findings:

### 1. Global Situation:
- **1990**: Global forest area was approximately 41,282,694.9 sq km.
- **2016**: This reduced to about 39,958,245.9 sq km.
- **Net Reduction**: 1,324,449 sq km from 1990 to 2016, translating to a percentage decrease of 3.21%. This lost forest area is almost equivalent to Peru's total area in 2016.

### 2. Regional Outlook:
- **2016**: The global forestation percentage was 31.38%. The Latin America & Caribbean region led with 46.16% forestation, while the Middle East & North Africa lagged at 2.07%.
- **1990**: Global forestation was slightly higher at 32.42%. The Latin America & Caribbean region had 51.03% forestation, and the Middle East & North Africa had 1.78%.
- **Decreased Forestation (1990-2016)**: Latin America & Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa regions experienced significant forestation decline.

### 3. Country-Level Detail:
- **Largest Forest Reduction (1990-2016)**: Brazil, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria, and Tanzania faced the most significant forest area decreases.
- **Percentage Decline Leaders**: Togo, Nigeria, Uganda, Mauritania, and Honduras.
- **Comparison with the US (2016)**: 94 countries had a forestation percentage surpassing the United States.

## Recommendations:
1. **Prioritize Latin America & Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa**: These regions have seen substantial forestation declines.
2. **Focus on Brazil, Indonesia, and Nigeria**: These countries have witnessed significant forest area reductions and may benefit from targeted interventions.
3. **Learn from Success Stories**: Recognize countries that have maintained or increased their forestation levels to derive best practices.

## Conclusion:
The data provides a roadmap for ForestQuery's leadership. With a clear understanding of global and regional trends, the team can allocate resources efficiently and design impactful interventions. The findings underscore the urgency required in specific regions while also highlighting potential success stories.
